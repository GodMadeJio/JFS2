    <h3>About me</h3>

    <p> <em><strong><a href= "https://www.hood.edu/"> Future Software engineer/Frontend Developer</a></strong>,
      CEO, Real estate Agent, and father of 3</em> </p>
    <p>As of today I am learning how to use Html and its also my first day of college.
    I want to be able to code alot more easily <br /> in the next 3 years or so, so i can be a top teir
    coder before i graduate. There are so many languages but I think thats  the fun <br /> part about this
    Job and im excited to see where i go with all this. </p>

    <h3> Education </h3>
    <p>I've been to plenty of schools in my life. I started off at a performance arts
      school. This is where my love for math began. <br /> I grew up being good at math so helping
      other people who struggled allowed me to appreciate being good at it. I went to a <br />few
      middle schools and elementary schools and didnt really grow a love for coding until
      I reached highschool. Now i am in <br /> my first year of college creating my first Html Site. Im
      one of the only kids in my family who actually went to college. </p>

      <h3>Family</h3>
      <p>I have two siblings, and as of today i still have both supporting parents.
         <br>I have a really good family (all across the world). My siblings consist <br> of
         a younger brother from my dad and an older sister from my mom.</p>
